What are Orphan and Zombie processes?

An orphan process is a child process whose parent isn't waiting for them 
anymore. The parent process of the orphan already finished executing and didn't
wait fot he child process.

Zombie processes are child processes where exit() was executed, but the parent
wasn't waiting for the child process. Most of the resources used for the zombie
process are recycled, but enough is left that when the parent process calls
wait the zombie process can die.


What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system 
call to execute a new program?

The child process executes the new program and then returns back to the
place it left off at in the original program. The parent doesn't know that
anything happened, it just knows the child process is running.
